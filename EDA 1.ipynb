    "The wine quality dataset typically contains various features related to wine characteristics, such as chemical composition, acidity levels, and physical properties. The key features of the wine quality dataset may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Fixed acidity: The amount of fixed acids present in the wine, such as tartaric acid. Fixed acidity contributes to the overall taste and stability of the wine. Wines with higher fixed acidity may have a more tart or sour taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Volatile acidity: The amount of volatile acids present in the wine, such as acetic acid. Excessive volatile acidity can result in off-flavors and unpleasant aromas, indicating poor wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Citric acid: The amount of citric acid present in the wine. Citric acid can contribute to the freshness and fruitiness of the wine, enhancing its flavor profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Residual sugar: The amount of residual sugar remaining in the wine after fermentation. Residual sugar can affect the sweetness of the wine and balance its acidity. Wines with higher residual sugar levels may be perceived as sweeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Chlorides: The concentration of chlorides in the wine. Chlorides can impact the taste and mouthfeel of the wine, with higher chloride levels potentially indicating poor winemaking practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide: The amount of free sulfur dioxide present in the wine. Sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative in winemaking to prevent oxidation and microbial spoilage. Adequate levels of free sulfur dioxide can help maintain wine quality and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of sulfur dioxide, including both free and bound forms, present in the wine. Total sulfur dioxide levels can provide insights into the wine's overall sulfite content and potential for sulfur-related off-flavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Density: The density of the wine, which can be influenced by factors such as sugar content and alcohol concentration. Density is a physical property that can indirectly reflect the wine's composition and concentration of dissolved substances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "pH: The pH level of the wine, which indicates its acidity or alkalinity. pH is a critical parameter in winemaking, as it affects microbial stability, color stability, and flavor perception. Wines with lower pH levels may have a more acidic taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Sulphates: The concentration of sulfates in the wine. Sulfates can contribute to the wine's aroma and act as antioxidants, helping to preserve its freshness and prevent oxidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine, typically expressed as a percentage by volume. Alcohol content can influence the wine's body, mouthfeel, and perceived warmth, as well as its aging potential."
