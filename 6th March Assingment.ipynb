    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average): This is the sum of all values in a data set divided by the number of values. For example, calculating the average income of a group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The middle value in a dataset when it is ordered. This is useful when there are extreme values (outliers) that might skew the mean. For instance, finding the median home price in a neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It's useful for identifying the most common response or characteristic. For example, determining the mode of preferred transportation in a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. This can give an idea of the variability in the data. For instance, calculating the range of temperatures over a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing: This involves making inferences about a population based on a sample from that population. For example, testing whether a new drug has a significant effect on lowering blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: These provide a range of values that likely contains the true value of a population parameter. For instance, estimating the average height of a population with a 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Analysis: This is used to model the relationship between variables and make predictions. For example, predicting the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): This is used to compare means of more than two groups. For instance, comparing the average test scores of students in different teaching methods."
