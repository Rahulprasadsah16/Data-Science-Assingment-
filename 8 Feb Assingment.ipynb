    "Here are a few ways to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: \n",
    "Encapsulation is a mechanism that combines data and methods into a single unit called a class. It allows you to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object from the outside world. By encapsulating data within a class, you provide a level of abstraction where the user can interact with the object using public methods without directly accessing or modifying the internal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers:\n",
    "Access modifiers (such as public, private, and protected) control the visibility and accessibility of data members and methods in a class. By using access modifiers appropriately, you can restrict direct access to certain data members and provide controlled access through public methods. This ensures that the internal details are hidden and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and Setter Methods: \n",
    "Getter and setter methods (also known as accessor and mutator methods) provide controlled access to private data members. Getters allow the user to retrieve the values of private data, while setters allow the user to modify the values. By using getter and setter methods, you can enforce validation, data consistency, and maintain data integrity while abstracting the actual storage and implementation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Classes and Interfaces: \n",
    "Abstract classes and interfaces provide a higher level of abstraction by defining a common interface that derived classes must adhere to. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by their derived classes, ensuring consistency and providing a contract for behavior. Interfaces define a set of method signatures that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface."
