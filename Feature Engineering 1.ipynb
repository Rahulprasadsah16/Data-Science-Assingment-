    "Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numerical features to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. It works by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing by the range (the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is particularly useful when the features have different ranges and units. It ensures that all features are on a similar scale, which can be important for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the features, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors.\n",

    "The Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, is another method used for feature scaling in data preprocessing. \n",
    "Unlike Min-Max scaling, which scales features to a specific range (typically between 0 and 1), normalization scales each feature such that the magnitude of each feature vector is 1. \n",
    "This ensures that all feature vectors have the same scale without necessarily constraining them to a specific range.\n",

    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique commonly used for feature extraction, especially in the context of dimensionality reduction. Feature extraction refers to the process of transforming raw data into a set of meaningful features that capture the essential characteristics of the data.

These principal components capture the maximum variance in the data and serve as a reduced representation of the original features.\n",
