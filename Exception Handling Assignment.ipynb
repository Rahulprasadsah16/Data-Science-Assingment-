    "Difference Between Exception and Syntax Errors :\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as a division by zero, attempting to access an undefined variable, or opening a file that doesn't exist. When an exception is raised, it creates an object that contains information about the error, such as the type of exception and a traceback that shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when you write code that violates the rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. Syntax errors typically result from typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, or using incorrect syntax for a specific programming construct.\n",
